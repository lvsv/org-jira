* org-jira mode

[[https://gitter.im/org-jira/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge][https://badges.gitter.im/org-jira/Lobby.svg]]

Use Jira in Emacs org-mode.

** Setup
*** Installation
    To install, just grab it off of MELPA (ensure your =~/.emacs= already has MELPA set up):
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'package)
      (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
      (package-initialize)
    #+END_SRC

    Then run =M-x package-install RET org-jira RET= and you're done!

*** Configuration
    In your =~/.emacs=, you should set the variable as such:
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      (setq jiralib-url "https://your-site.atlassian.net")
    #+END_SRC

    If you don't want to enter your credentials (login/password) each time you go to connect, you can add to your =~/.authinfo.gpg= or =~/.authinfo= file, in a format similar to:
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      machine your-site.atlassian.net login you@example.com password yourPassword port 80
    #+END_SRC

    _Please note that in the authinfo file, port 80 should be specified even if your jiralib-url is https._

** Usage
*** Getting Started
    org-jira mode is easy to use, to get started (after installing this library) try running =M-x org-jira-get-issues=.  You should see that it pulls in all issues that are assigned to you.
    
    Following that, you can try out some of the org-jira mode commands by visiting one of the files (they're named after your Jira project code, for example, 'EX.org' for a project named 'EX').

*** Keybinds
    Some of the important keybindings:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (define-key org-jira-map (kbd "C-c pg") 'org-jira-get-projects)
